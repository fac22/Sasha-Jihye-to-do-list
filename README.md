# Sasha-Jihye-to-do-list

**The project Sasha and Jihye working on**

<br>

## User stories

<br>

### Core

**As a busy person, I want to:**

- Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them

```
test("Submitting a new task adds it to the list", () => {
  // test goes here
});
```

- Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done

```
test("Checking an entry marks it as complete", () => {
  // test goes here
});
```

- Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore

```
test("Deleting an entry removes it from the list", () => {
  // test goes here
});
```

**As a motor-impaired user, I want to:**

- Use all the features of the app without a mouse

<br>

### Stretch

**As a busy person, I want to:**

- Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what’s left to do

```
test("Toggling the filter hides completed tasks from the list", () => {
  // test goes here
});
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- A working to-do list
- Tests for (at least) each user story
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
